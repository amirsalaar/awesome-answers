  # This is the Question model. We generated
  # this file with the command:
  # > rails generate model question title:string body:text
  # This command also generates a migragtion file in db/migrate

  # Rails will automatically add attr_accessors for
  # all of the columns of the table (i.e. title body,
  # created_at, updated_at)

  # Adding the 'dependent: :destroy' option tells
  # Rails to delete associated records before
  # deleting the record itself. In this case
  # specifically, when a question is deleted,
  # its answers are deleted first to satisfy the
  # foreign key constraint.
  # You can also use dependent: :nullify, which
  # will cause all associated answers to have
  # their question_id column set to NULL before the
  # question is destroyed.
  # If you don't set either dependent option you can
  # end up with answers in your db referencing
  # question_ids that no longer exist. Always set
  # a dependent option to help maintain referential
  # integrity
  has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy
  # 'has_many :answers' adds the following instance
  # methods to the Question model:

  # answers
  # answers<<(object, ...)
  # answers.delete(object, ...)
  # answers.destroy(object, ...)
  # answers=(objects)
  # answers_singular_ids
  # answers_singular_ids=(ids)
  # answers.clear
  # answers.empty?
  # answers.size
  # answers.find(...)
  # answers.where(...)
  # answers.exists?(...)
  # answers.build(attributes = {}, ...)
  # answers.create(attributes = {})
  # answers.create!(attributes = {})
  # answers.reload



  # Create validations by using the 'validates' method.
  # The arguments are (in order):
  # - A column name as a symbol
  # - Named arguments, corresponding to the validation
  # rules

  # before_validation is a lifecycle callback method
  # that allows us to respond to events during the life
  # of a model instance. (e.g. being validated, created,
  # updated, etc.). All lifecycle callback methods take a

  # the appropriate time.

  # Create a scope with a class method
  # Scopes are such a commonly used feature, that there

  # And a lambda as a callback.
